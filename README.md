Project Overview: Tiara's  E-Commerce Platform

We have developed  an e-commerce platform specializing in shoe sales. The project aims to provide a seamless 
online shopping experience with features like product listings, detailed product pages, a shopping cart with total calculations, 
filtering, and search functionality. We built the frontend using React, Redux, and Tailwind CSS, ensuring a responsive and efficient UI. 
The backend, developed with Node.js, manages user authentication, product data, and order processing.
